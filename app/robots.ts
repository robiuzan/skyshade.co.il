/**
 * AI crawlers we explicitly allow — fleet-wide policy, identical across all sites.
 *
 * `User-agent: *` already permits these, so this block is **declarative, not
 * enforcing**. It exists so the stance is visible rather than implied, and so it
 * survives a platform default changing underneath us.
 *
 *   - Retrieval bots (OAI-SearchBot, ChatGPT-User, Claude-User, Claude-SearchBot,
 *     PerplexityBot, Perplexity-User) fetch a page to answer a live question and
 *     cite the source. For a lead-gen service site these are the whole point —
 *     a blocked crawler cannot cite what it cannot read.
 *   - Training bots (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Google-Extended, Applebot-Extended, CCBot)
 *     bring no direct citation benefit, but there is nothing proprietary here to
 *     protect and no meaningful cost to serving them.
 *
 * ⚠️ Cloudflare can PREPEND a managed block at the edge that overrides everything
 * here — it did exactly that across this fleet until 2026-08. Nothing in this file
 * can undo it; that is a zone setting. Verify the live policy, never infer it here:
 *
 *   curl -sS -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' "https://skyshade.co.il/robots.txt?cb=$RANDOM"
